# Photo Editing Program
This project was created using c++. The purpose of this project is to explore how basic photo editing features work. It includes functions such as multiply, overlay, screen, and more.

# Implementation
The program reads .tga files and outputs modified .tga files. The modified files are compared to example output files. Gimp can be used to view the raw and modified files as well as the example outputs. The test cases run different modification functions on the raw files and write to a modified file, then test the modified file against the example file. They are compared pixel, by pixel.
